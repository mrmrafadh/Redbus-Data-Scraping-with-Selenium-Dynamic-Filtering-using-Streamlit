Redbus-Data-Scraping-with-Selenium-Dynamic-Filtering-using-Streamlit
By utilizing Selenium for web scraping, this project automates the extraction of detailed information from Redbus, including bus routes, schedules, prices, and seat availability. This project would enable data-driven decision-making, improve operational efficiency and strategic planning in the transportation industry.

Approach:

Data Scraping: Use Selenium to automate the extraction of Redbus data including routes, schedules, prices, and seat availability.

Data Storage: Store the scraped data in a SQL database.

Streamlit Application: Develop a Streamlit application to display and filter the scraped data. Implement various filters such as bustype, route, price range, star rating, availability.

Data Analysis/Filtering using Streamlit: Use SQL queries to retrieve and filter data based on user inputs. Use Streamlit to allow users to interact with and filter the data through the application.

Business Use Cases: The solution can be applied to various business scenarios including:

Travel Aggregators: Providing real-time bus schedules and seat availability for customers.

Market Analysis: Analyzing travel patterns and preferences for market research.

Customer Service: Enhancing user experience by offering customized travel options based on data insights.

Competitor Analysis: Comparing pricing and service levels with competitors.
